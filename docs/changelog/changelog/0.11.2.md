## Enhancements and Fixes

### Templates

- **Environment Configuration Enhancement**: Replaced `foamExec` with `findBashrc`. Optimizes execution environment for OpenFOAM simulations by ensuring accurate script environment configurations.

- **Update Process Optimization**: Implemented parallel updates. Accelerates the software update process, reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency.

- **Large Case Import Fix**: Addressed import issues in `simpleFoam` and `pimpleFoam` for very large simulations. Ensures stability and performance when handling extensive simulation cases.

- **Mesh Refinement Accessibility**: Added a table with volume refinement levels to `snappyHexMesh`. Provides an intuitive interface for mesh refinement, facilitating precise control over meshing.

- **STL File Mesh Refinement**: Introduced volume refinement for STL files in `snappyHexMesh`. Enhances mesh quality around complex geometries for more accurate simulation results.

- **UI Streamlining**: Removed unused "advanced options"-related components in `simpleFoam` and `pimpleFoam`. Simplifies simulation setup by focusing the user interface on essential functionalities.

- **JupyterLab Integration Enhancement**: Added missing `jupyterlab_service` in the single-core flow for `simplefoam`.

- **Advanced Meshing Options**: Included `writeFlags` in `snappyHexMesh` advanced options. Allows advanced users to fine-tune mesh generation parameters.

### Services

- **User Feedback Service Fix**: Resolved loading issue with the UserSnap service. Ensures effective user feedback collection and responsiveness.

### Additional Notes

- A significant number of small bugs were resolved, further stabilizing the platform and improving overall functionality and user experience.
