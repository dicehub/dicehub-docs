## Enhancements and Fixes

### Templates

- **Micro Runs Implementation**: Implemented micro runs. This update introduces a new feature that allows for smaller, more focused simulations, providing users with the ability to conduct quick tests or experiments without the need for full-scale runs.

- **Refinement Volume Improvements**: Added cylinder option to refinement volumes in `snappyHexMesh`. This enhancement expands the mesh refinement capabilities by allowing users to specify cylindrical volumes for targeted refinement, improving mesh accuracy in cylindrical regions.

- **Dynamic Physical Properties Update**: Updated `physicalProperties` during run in `simpleFoam` and `pimpleFoam`. This improvement enables dynamic updating of physical properties during simulations, allowing for more accurate and responsive simulation environments that can adapt to changes in simulation conditions in real-time.
