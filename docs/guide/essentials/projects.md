# Projects

<div class="h1-sub">
  Use projects to group all things related to your domain.

A dicehub project is a space where you can find all the things related to a specific problem. 
Projects contain applications and can be shared with other users by adding them as members.

Things you can do in a project:

- [Create a project](./#create-a-project)
- [Create an application](./#create-an-application)
- [Create a group](./#create-a-group)

## Create a project

Projects can be used for work on a specific topic (for example "Car aerodynamics"). 
In a project you can create applications to solve your simulation problem.

To create a project in dicehub:
