## HPC Machines

A dicehub machine is a computational resource in the cloud (for example a virtual or dedicated server). 
When you specify the amount of cores and nodes a small cluster of 
servers where your calculation is executed, is assigned to you .

The following machines are available on dicehub.com:

### Is multithreading enabled?

Multithreading in most cases does not significantly improve the solution time for CFD simulations. 
Because of this, for all dicehub machines multithreading is disabled.
